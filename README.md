# Mathematics for Macroeconomics: Source Files

This repository contains the source files for the course "Mathematics for Macroeconomics", developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/), and taught at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

## Course webpage

The course materials are available at https://pascalmichaillat.org/x/.

## Lecture notes

The source files for the lecture notes are located in the `lecturenotes` folder. The lecture notes are written in LaTeX and compiled to PDF using pdfTeX:

+ `notes1.tex`, `notes1.pdf` - Lecture notes on dynamic programming
+ `notes2.tex`, `notes2.pdf` - Lecture notes on optimal control
+ `notes3.tex`, `notes3.pdf` - Lecture notes on differential equations (`phasediagrams.key` and `phasediagrams.pdf` contain the phase diagrams used in `notes3.tex`)

## Problem sets

The source files for the problem sets are located in the `problemsets` folder. The problem sets are written in LaTeX and compiled to PDF using pdfTeX:

+ `ps1.tex`, `ps1.pdf` - Problem set on dynamic programming
+ `ps2.tex`, `ps2.pdf` - Problem set on optimal control
+ `ps3.tex`, `ps3.pdf` - Problem set on differential equations
+ `ps4.tex`, `ps4.pdf` - Cumulative problem set covering all three topics

Solutions to the problems sets are available to instructors [upon request](mailto:pascal.michaillat@gmail.com).

## Style files

The folders also contain the LaTeX style files used to format the lecture notes and problem sets:

+ `paper.sty` - [Formatting for academic papers](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper) 
+ `notes.sty` -Formatting adjustments for lecture notes
+ `math.sty` - [Commands to write math](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math)
